This program simulates a search for the shortest path between two points, in a space filled with convex
polygonal obstacles.

## Running the application
To run this program, run the following command:

python main.py [filename]

where filename is the path to the input data.


## Input Data
The first row of the input data should consist of the starting point

The second row should consist of the goal node

Each following row should consist of the vertices of a convex polygonal obstacle.
